Using the zynamics ida-msdn IDA Pro plugin you can import Windows API
documentation from the MSDN into your IDA Pro IDB files.

1. Usage

- At first you have to extract MSDN documentation from a local installation
  of the MSDN. You can use the zynamics MSDN crawler for this which you can
  download from http://github.com/zynamics/msdn-crawler
- Once the MSDN crawler has generated the msdn.xml file you have to adjust
  the path to the msdn.xml file in ida_importer.py
- Using IDAPython 1.3.2 or higher you can then execute ida_importer.py

2. License

The MSDN crawler is licensed under the GPL 2.0 license. Please see gpl.txt for
more information.
